# Debug Shell Script Issues

Analyze the selected shell script for debugging and troubleshooting. Focus on:

## Error Analysis

- **Runtime Errors**: Identify potential sources of script failures
- **Logic Errors**: Check for incorrect conditionals, loops, and variable assignments
- **Race Conditions**: Look for timing issues in concurrent operations
- **Resource Issues**: Memory usage, file descriptor leaks, disk space

## Debugging Strategies

- Add strategic `echo` statements for variable tracking
- Implement verbose mode with `set -x` conditionally
- Add breakpoints using `read -p "Press enter to continue..."`
- Use `trap` for debugging function entry/exit

## Environment Issues

- **Path Problems**: Incorrect file paths, missing directories
- **Permission Issues**: Insufficient privileges for operations
- **Dependency Missing**: Commands or packages not available
- **Environment Variables**: Missing or incorrect environment setup

## Diagnostic Additions

```bash
# Add debugging function
debug() {
  if [[ "${DEBUG:-false}" == "true" ]]; then
    echo "DEBUG: $*" >&2
  fi
}

# Add function tracing
trace_function() {
  debug "Entering function: ${FUNCNAME[1]} with args: $*"
}
```

## Output Requirements

- Provide specific debugging code to insert
- Suggest command-line debugging techniques
- Include logging enhancements for troubleshooting
- Recommend tools for script analysis (shellcheck, etc.)

Focus on practical debugging additions that help identify and resolve runtime issues.
