<think>Let me analyze the env-detect.sh script from the codebase context provided:

```sh:env-detect.sh
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -euo pipefail

# Source the environment utility
SCRIPT_DIR="$(cd "$(dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")" && pwd)"
source "$SCRIPT_DIR/util-env.sh"

# Call the function to output the environment type
detect_environment
```

This is a very simple script that:
1. Uses proper shebang and error handling
2. Gets the script directory properly
3. Sources the util-env.sh utility
4. Calls the detect_environment function

The script is extremely minimal - it's essentially just a wrapper that sources util-env.sh and calls detect_environment.

Let me think about potential improvements:

1. **Error Handling**: The script doesn't check if util-env.sh exists before sourcing it
2. **Return Code Handling**: It doesn't handle the return code from detect_environment
3. **Usage Information**: No help text or usage information
4. **Logging**: No logging capability
5. **Validation**: No validation that detect_environment function exists after sourcing

Actually, looking at this more carefully, this is such a minimal script that most improvements would be overkill for its purpose. It's designed to be a simple wrapper.

However, there are some potential improvements:

1. **Missing Error Handling for Source Operation**: The script doesn't check if util-env.sh exists or can be sourced successfully
2. **No Function Existence Validation**: After sourcing, it doesn't verify that detect_environment function is available
3. **Missing Usage Documentation**: No help text or parameter handling
4. **No Return Code Management**: Doesn't handle or propagate return codes properly
5. **Missing Logging Integration**: Could benefit from logging capability for debugging

But honestly, for such a simple wrapper script, most of these might be overkill. Let me focus on the most practical improvements.</think>
After analyzing the `env-detect.sh` script, I identified several areas where this minimal wrapper could be enhanced to improve robustness and maintainability:

## **1. Missing Error Handling for Critical Dependencies**

**Issue**: The script sources `util-env.sh` without verifying the file exists or can be loaded successfully. If the utility file is missing or corrupted, the script will fail with an unclear error message.

**Benefits**: Proper dependency validation provides clear error messages for troubleshooting, improves script reliability, and makes debugging easier when the utility file is missing or has issues.

**Recommendation**:
```bash:env-detect.sh
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -euo pipefail

# Source the environment utility with error handling
SCRIPT_DIR="$(cd "$(dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")" && pwd)"
UTIL_ENV_PATH="$SCRIPT_DIR/util-env.sh"

# Validate utility file exists and is readable
if [[ ! -f "$UTIL_ENV_PATH" ]]; then
    echo "Error: Required utility file not found: $UTIL_ENV_PATH" >&2
    echo "Please ensure util-env.sh is in the same directory as this script" >&2
    exit 127
fi

if [[ ! -r "$UTIL_ENV_PATH" ]]; then
    echo "Error: Cannot read utility file: $UTIL_ENV_PATH" >&2
    echo "Please check file permissions" >&2
    exit 126
fi

# Source the utility with error handling
if ! source "$UTIL_ENV_PATH"; then
    echo "Error: Failed to load utility functions from $UTIL_ENV_PATH" >&2
    echo "The utility file may be corrupted or contain syntax errors" >&2
    exit 1
fi
```

## **2. Lack of Function Availability Validation**

**Issue**: The script assumes the `detect_environment` function exists after sourcing the utility file, but doesn't verify this assumption. If the function is missing or renamed, the script fails with a cryptic "command not found" error.

**Benefits**: Function validation ensures the required functionality is available, provides clear error messages when functions are missing, and helps identify version mismatches between scripts and utilities.

**Recommendation**:
```bash:env-detect.sh
# Validate required function is available after sourcing
if ! declare -f detect_environment >/dev/null 2>&1; then
    echo "Error: detect_environment function not found in $UTIL_ENV_PATH" >&2
    echo "Please ensure you have the correct version of util-env.sh" >&2
    echo "Expected function: detect_environment" >&2
    exit 1
fi

# Verify function is callable (additional safety check)
if ! type -t detect_environment >/dev/null 2>&1; then
    echo "Error: detect_environment is not a callable function" >&2
    exit 1
fi
```

## **3. Missing Usage Documentation and Parameter Handling**

**Issue**: The script provides no usage information, help text, or parameter handling capabilities. Users cannot get information about what the script does or how to use it, which reduces usability and maintainability.

**Benefits**: Usage documentation improves user experience, makes the script self-documenting, enables help functionality, and provides clear expectations about script behavior.

**Recommendation**:
```bash:env-detect.sh
# Function to display usage information
show_usage() {
    cat << EOF
Usage: $(basename "$0") [OPTIONS]

Description:
    Detects and reports the current environment type (WSL2, Desktop, or Headless).
    This script is a wrapper for the detect_environment function in util-env.sh.

Options:
    -h, --help          Show this help message and exit
    -v, --verbose       Enable verbose output with additional details
    -q, --quiet         Suppress all output except the environment type
    --json              Output result in JSON format
    --version           Show script version information

Output:
    Prints one of the following environment types:
    - WSL2      : Windows Subsystem for Linux 2
    - DESKTOP   : Ubuntu Desktop environment
    - HEADLESS  : Ubuntu Server/headless environment

Examples:
    $(basename "$0")                    # Detect and display environment
    $(basename "$0") --json             # Output in JSON format
    $(basename "$0") --quiet            # Output only environment type

Exit Codes:
    0   Success - environment detected
    1   General error
    127 Required utility file not found
    126 Permission denied

            exit 1
            ;;
    esac
done
```

## **4. Inadequate Return Code and Output Management**

**Issue**: The script doesn't properly handle or validate the return code from `detect_environment`, and it doesn't provide flexible output options for different use cases (scripting vs. interactive use).

**Benefits**: Proper return code handling enables reliable script chaining and automation, flexible output options support different integration scenarios, and error handling provides better debugging capabilities.

**Recommendation**:
```bash:env-detect.sh
# Enhanced environment detection with proper error handling
detect_and_report_environment() {
    local env_type
    local exit_code=0
    
    # Call detect_environment and capture both output and exit code
    if env_type=$(detect_environment 2>/dev/null); then
        # Success case - environment detected
        if [[ "$JSON_OUTPUT" == "true" ]]; then
            # JSON output format
            cat << EOF
{
    "environment": "$env_type",
    "timestamp": "$(date -Iseconds)",
    "hostname": "$(hostname)",
    "status": "success"
}
EOF
        elif [[ "$QUIET" == "true" ]]; then
            # Quiet mode - just the environment type
            echo "$env_type"
        else
            # Standard output with additional information
            echo "Environment Type: $env_type"
            
            if [[ "$VERBOSE" == "true" ]]; then
                echo "Detection Time: $(date)"
                echo "Hostname: $(hostname)"
                echo "User: $(whoami)"
                echo "Shell: $SHELL"
                
                # Add environment-specific details
                case "$env_type" in
                    "WSL2")
                        echo "WSL Distribution: ${WSL_DISTRO_NAME:-unknown}"
                        echo "Windows Version: $(cmd.exe /c ver 2>/dev/null | tr -d '\r' || echo 'unknown')"
                        ;;
                    "DESKTOP")
                        echo "Desktop Environment: ${XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP:-unknown}"
                        echo "Display Server: ${XDG_SESSION_TYPE:-unknown}"
                        ;;
                    "HEADLESS")
                        echo "System Type: Headless/Server"
                        echo "Systemd: $(systemctl is-system-running 2>/dev/null || echo 'not available')"
                        ;;
                esac
            fi
        fi
    else
        # Error case - detection failed
        exit_code=$?
        
        if [[ "$JSON_OUTPUT" == "true" ]]; then
            cat << EOF
{
    "environment": null,
    "timestamp": "$(date -Iseconds)",
    "status": "error",
    "error": "Environment detection failed"
}
EOF
        elif [[ "$QUIET" != "true" ]]; then
            echo "Error: Failed to detect environment type" >&2
            echo "Please check that util-env.sh contains a working detect_environment function" >&2
        fi
    fi
    
    return $exit_code
}

# Call the enhanced detection function
detect_and_report_environment
exit_code=$?

# Exit with the appropriate code
exit $exit_code
```

## **5. Missing Integration with Logging and Debugging Infrastructure**

**Issue**: The script operates in isolation without integration into the broader logging infrastructure used by other scripts in the project. This makes debugging and monitoring more difficult in complex deployment scenarios.

**Benefits**: Logging integration provides consistent debugging capabilities, enables centralized monitoring, supports troubleshooting in complex environments, and maintains consistency with other project scripts.

**Recommendation**:
```bash:env-detect.sh
# Optional logging integration (if util-log.sh is available)
UTIL_LOG_PATH="$SCRIPT_DIR/util-log.sh"
LOGGING_AVAILABLE=false

if [[ -f "$UTIL_LOG_PATH" ]] && [[ -r "$UTIL_LOG_PATH" ]]; then
    if source "$UTIL_LOG_PATH" 2>/dev/null; then
        LOGGING_AVAILABLE=true
        # Initialize logging if available
        if declare -f init_logging >/dev/null 2>&1; then
            init_logging 2>/dev/null || true
        fi
    fi
fi

# Enhanced logging functions with fallback
log_debug() {
    if [[ "$LOGGING_AVAILABLE" == "true" ]] && declare -f log_debug >/dev/null 2>&1; then
        log_debug "$@"
    elif [[ "$VERBOSE" == "true" ]]; then
        echo "DEBUG: $*" >&2
    fi
}

log_info() {
    if [[ "$LOGGING_AVAILABLE" == "true" ]] && declare -f log_info >/dev/null 2>&1; then
        log_info "$@"
    elif [[ "$QUIET" != "true" ]]; then
        echo "INFO: $*" >&2
    fi
}

log_error() {
    if [[ "$LOGGING_AVAILABLE" == "true" ]] && declare -f log_error >/dev/null 2>&1; then
        log_error "$@"
    else
        echo "ERROR: $*" >&2
    fi
}

# Enhanced main execution with logging
main() {
    log_debug "Starting environment detection"
    log_debug "Script directory: $SCRIPT_DIR"
    log_debug "Utility path: $UTIL_ENV_PATH"
    
    # Source utility with logging
    log_debug "Loading environment utilities"
    if ! source "$UTIL_ENV_PATH"; then
        log_error "Failed to load utility functions from $UTIL_ENV_PATH"
        return 1
    fi
    
    # Validate function availability
    log_debug "Validating detect_environment function availability"
    if ! declare -f detect_environment >/dev/null 2>&1; then
        log_error "detect_environment function not found in $UTIL_ENV_PATH"
        return 1
    fi
    
    # Execute detection with logging
    log_debug "Executing environment detection"
    if detect_and_report_environment; then
        log_debug "Environment detection completed successfully"
        return 0
    else
        local exit_code=$?
        log_error "Environment detection failed with exit code: $exit_code"
        return $exit_code
    fi
}

# Execute main function if script is run directly
if [[ "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}" == "${0}" ]]; then
    main "$@"
fi
```
