<think>Let me carefully analyze the `check-prerequisites.sh` script provided in the context. I need to look for code smells, readability issues, maintainability problems, performance issues, security concerns, etc.

Looking at the script:

```sh
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# check-prerequisites.sh - Verify system requirements for installation
set -euo pipefail

# Source utility modules
SCRIPT_DIR="$(cd "$(dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")" && pwd)"
source "$SCRIPT_DIR/util-log.sh"
source "$SCRIPT_DIR/util-env.sh"

# Initialize logging
init_logging
log_info "Prerequisites check started"

# Define prerequisite checks for progress tracking
declare -a PREREQ_CHECKS=(
  "root_check"
  "sudo_privileges"
  "internet_connectivity"
  "ubuntu_version"
  "disk_space"
  "essential_commands"
  "apt_functionality"
  "environment_detection"
  "memory_check"
)

PREREQUISITES_MET=true
current_check=0
total_checks=${#PREREQ_CHECKS[@]}

# Check 1: Root user check
current_check=$((current_check + 1))
log_info "[$current_check/$total_checks] Checking user privileges..."
show_progress "$current_check" "$total_checks" "Prerequisites Check"

if [[ $EUID -eq 0 ]]; then
   log_warning "Running as root is not recommended. Please run as a regular user with sudo privileges."
fi

# Check 2: Sudo privileges
current_check=$((current_check + 1))
log_info "[$current_check/$total_checks] Checking sudo privileges..."
show_progress "$current_check" "$total_checks" "Prerequisites Check"

log_info "Testing sudo without password prompt..."
if ! timeout 5 sudo -n true 2>/dev/null; then
    log_warning "sudo privileges are required for package installation"
    log_info "Requesting sudo password (timeout: 30 seconds)..."
    if ! timeout 30 sudo -v 2>/dev/null; then
        log_error "Failed to obtain sudo privileges or timed out"
        PREREQUISITES_MET=false
    else
        log_success "sudo privileges confirmed"
    fi
else
    log_success "sudo privileges available (no password required)"
fi

I'll verify the sudo access mechanism carefully. The script checks for sudo privileges through two distinct approaches. First, it attempts a non-interactive sudo check with a 5-second timeout. If this fails, it prompts for sudo authentication with a 30-second window. This ensures the user has necessary system-level permissions while maintaining security by not storing passwords in plain text.

The script uses a timeout mechanism to prevent indefinite waiting, and logs different outcomes - warning, error, or success - providing clear feedback about the sudo access status. By setting `PREREQUISITES_MET` to false on failure, it ensures subsequent steps won't proceed without proper authorization.

I'll check internet connectivity by pinging reliable endpoints. The primary test targets google.com, with a fallback to Google's DNS (8.8.8.8) if the first attempt fails. This dual-strategy ensures network availability is thoroughly validated before proceeding with package operations.

The 10-second timeout prevents prolonged waiting, and the script captures both DNS resolution and general network connectivity issues. Logging success or specific failure reasons helps diagnose potential network problems.

Next, I'll verify the Ubuntu distribution and version compatibility. I'll extract the major and minor version numbers, confirming support for versions 20.04 and newer. Non-Ubuntu systems or unidentifiable distributions will trigger appropriate warning messages, ensuring system compatibility before further installation steps.

I'll then assess available disk space, checking if at least 5GB are free. This critical prerequisite ensures sufficient storage for potential software or system requirements. The script incrementally tracks progress through prerequisite checks, logging informative messages about available space.

The next check will likely involve validating essential system commands, continuing the systematic validation process to prepare for subsequent installation or configuration tasks.

I'll verify core commands like curl, wget, git, sudo, and bc are present, marking the overall prerequisites status accordingly. Each command's availability gets logged, providing transparent feedback about system readiness.

The script methodically progresses through validation stages, incrementing a check counter and displaying progress to give users clear insight into the system preparation process.

Next, I'll test apt update functionality with a 60-second timeout. If the update succeeds, I'll log a success message; otherwise, I'll flag a potential network or repository configuration issue and mark prerequisites as unmet.

The environment detection phase will identify the specific system context, with special attention to WSL environments. I'll confirm the WSL version and prepare to validate additional system-specific requirements.

For WSL2, I'll specifically check systemd status. If systemd isn't running, I'll generate a warning about configuration adjustments needed. Desktop and headless environments will also be logged for context.

The memory assessment follows, retrieving and logging available system memory to ensure sufficient resources for subsequent operations.

If memory falls below 2GB, I'll flag a warning about potential resource constraints. The final stage evaluates whether all prerequisites have been successfully met, providing a comprehensive summary and determining whether the installation can proceed based on the checks performed.

The script systematically validates system readiness, with clear exit strategies for success or failure scenarios, ensuring robust pre-installation validation.

Key observations include a structured approach to system checks, utilizing logging mechanisms and progress tracking to provide transparent feedback about the installation preparation process.

The implementation demonstrates careful attention to error handling and system compatibility verification, with mechanisms in place to prevent installation under unsuitable conditions.

Potential enhancements could involve making configuration parameters more flexible and reducing code repetition through function abstraction.

Critical improvements include expanding network connectivity testing beyond single endpoints, implementing more robust version comparison logic, and developing a configuration file mechanism to support diverse environment requirements.

The current approach lacks granular failure reporting and user control options like selective check skipping or forced continuation, which would significantly improve the script's adaptability and user experience.

Key enhancements focus on creating a more flexible, configurable prerequisite checking system that can dynamically handle different network environments, version comparisons, and provide meaningful guidance when checks encounter issues.

I'll prioritize developing modular functions that allow selective check execution, with robust error handling and clear recovery paths. The goal is to transform the current script into a more adaptable, user-friendly validation mechanism that can gracefully manage complex system prerequisite scenarios.</think>
After analyzing the `check-prerequisites.sh` script, I identified several areas where the code could be enhanced to improve robustness, maintainability, and user experience:

## **1. Hardcoded Configuration Values and Magic Numbers**

**Issue**: Multiple hardcoded values throughout the script (timeout values: 5, 10, 30, 60 seconds; disk space: 5GB; memory: 2GB; Ubuntu version: 20.04+) make the script inflexible and difficult to adapt for different environments or requirements.

**Benefits**: Configurable parameters improve script reusability across different environments, enable easy customization for enterprise deployments, and allow fine-tuning based on specific use cases without code modification.

**Recommendation**:
```bash:check-prerequisites.sh
# Configuration section - make all thresholds configurable
readonly SUDO_TIMEOUT="${SUDO_TIMEOUT:-30}"
readonly NETWORK_TIMEOUT="${NETWORK_TIMEOUT:-10}"
readonly APT_TIMEOUT="${APT_TIMEOUT:-60}"
readonly MIN_DISK_SPACE_GB="${MIN_DISK_SPACE_GB:-5}"
readonly MIN_MEMORY_GB="${MIN_MEMORY_GB:-2}"
readonly MIN_UBUNTU_VERSION_MAJOR="${MIN_UBUNTU_VERSION_MAJOR:-20}"
readonly MIN_UBUNTU_VERSION_MINOR="${MIN_UBUNTU_VERSION_MINOR:-4}"

# Load configuration from file if available
if [[ -f "${SCRIPT_DIR}/prerequisites.conf" ]]; then
    log_info "Loading configuration from prerequisites.conf"
    source "${SCRIPT_DIR}/prerequisites.conf"
fi

# Allow environment variable overrides
load_check_configuration() {
    log_info "Using configuration: Disk=${MIN_DISK_SPACE_GB}GB, Memory=${MIN_MEMORY_GB}GB, Timeouts=${NETWORK_TIMEOUT}s"
}
```

## **2. Highly Repetitive Check Pattern and Code Duplication**

**Issue**: Each prerequisite check follows an identical pattern (increment counter, log info, show progress, perform check), resulting in significant code duplication and making the script harder to maintain and extend.

**Benefits**: Abstracting the check pattern reduces code duplication, improves maintainability, makes adding new checks easier, and ensures consistent behavior across all prerequisite checks.

**Recommendation**:
```bash:check-prerequisites.sh
# Abstract check execution pattern
execute_prerequisite_check() {
    local check_name="$1"
    local check_description="$2"
    local check_function="$3"
    local is_critical="${4:-true}"
    
    current_check=$((current_check + 1))
    log_info "[$current_check/$total_checks] $check_description..."
    show_progress "$current_check" "$total_checks" "Prerequisites Check"
    
    local check_start_time
    check_start_time=$(date +%s)
    
    if "$check_function"; then
        local duration=$(($(date +%s) - check_start_time))
        log_success "$check_description completed (${duration}s)"
        return 0
    else
        local duration=$(($(date +%s) - check_start_time))
        if [[ "$is_critical" == "true" ]]; then
            log_error "$check_description failed (${duration}s)"
            PREREQUISITES_MET=false
        else
            log_warning "$check_description failed but not critical (${duration}s)"
        fi
        return 1
    fi
}

# Refactored check functions
check_user_privileges() {
    if [[ $EUID -eq 0 ]]; then
        log_warning "Running as root is not recommended. Please run as a regular user with sudo privileges."
    fi
    return 0
}

check_sudo_access() {
    log_info "Testing sudo without password prompt..."
    if ! timeout "$SUDO_TIMEOUT" sudo -n true 2>/dev/null; then
        log_warning "sudo privileges are required for package installation"
        log_info "Requesting sudo password (timeout: ${SUDO_TIMEOUT} seconds)..."
        if ! timeout "$SUDO_TIMEOUT" sudo -v 2>/dev/null; then
            log_error "Failed to obtain sudo privileges or timed out"
            return 1
        fi
    fi
    log_success "sudo privileges confirmed"
    return 0
}

# Execute checks using the abstracted pattern
execute_prerequisite_check "user_privileges" "Checking user privileges" "check_user_privileges" "false"
execute_prerequisite_check "sudo_access" "Checking sudo privileges" "check_sudo_access" "true"
```

## **3. Insufficient Network Connectivity Testing and Corporate Environment Support**

**Issue**: Network connectivity testing only attempts connections to google.com and 8.8.8.8, which may fail in corporate environments with restrictive firewalls, proxy servers, or in regions where Google services are blocked.

**Benefits**: Robust network testing ensures accurate connectivity assessment across diverse network environments, provides better diagnostic information for network issues, and supports enterprise and international deployment scenarios.

**Recommendation**:
```bash:check-prerequisites.sh
check_internet_connectivity() {
    log_info "Testing internet connectivity (timeout: ${NETWORK_TIMEOUT} seconds)..."
    
    # Define multiple test targets for comprehensive connectivity testing
    local connectivity_targets=(
        "8.8.8.8"              # Google DNS
<think>The user wants me to continue with the recommendation I was providing about network connectivity testing. I need to complete that recommendation and then continue with the remaining suggestions for improving the check-prerequisites.sh script.</think>
```bash:check-prerequisites.sh
check_internet_connectivity() {
    log_info "Testing internet connectivity (timeout: ${NETWORK_TIMEOUT} seconds)..."
    
    # Define multiple test targets for comprehensive connectivity testing
    local connectivity_targets=(
        "8.8.8.8"              # Google DNS
        "1.1.1.1"              # Cloudflare DNS
        "archive.ubuntu.com"    # Ubuntu package repository
        "github.com"           # Development platform
        "microsoft.com"        # Enterprise-friendly target
    )
    
    local proxy_config=""
    if [[ -n "${HTTP_PROXY:-}" ]] || [[ -n "${http_proxy:-}" ]]; then
        proxy_config="--proxy ${HTTP_PROXY:-$http_proxy}"
        log_info "Proxy configuration detected: ${HTTP_PROXY:-$http_proxy}"
    fi
    
    local successful_connections=0
    local connection_details=()
    
    for target in "${connectivity_targets[@]}"; do
        local test_method="ping"
        local test_command="timeout ${NETWORK_TIMEOUT} ping -c 1 -W 3 $target"
        
        # For HTTP targets, use curl if available
        if [[ "$target" =~ \.(com|org|net)$ ]] && command -v curl >/dev/null 2>&1; then
            test_method="http"
            test_command="timeout ${NETWORK_TIMEOUT} curl -sf $proxy_config --connect-timeout 5 --max-time ${NETWORK_TIMEOUT} -I https://$target"
        fi
        
        if eval "$test_command" >/dev/null 2>&1; then
            ((successful_connections++))
            connection_details+=("✓ $target ($test_method)")
            log_info "Connection successful: $target"
        else
            connection_details+=("✗ $target ($test_method)")
            log_warning "Connection failed: $target"
        fi
    done
    
    # Evaluate connectivity based on successful connections
    if [[ $successful_connections -eq 0 ]]; then
        log_error "No internet connectivity detected"
        log_info "Connection test results:"
        printf '%s\n' "${connection_details[@]}" | while read -r line; do log_info "  $line"; done
        
        # Provide troubleshooting guidance
        log_info "Troubleshooting suggestions:"
        log_info "  - Check network configuration and DNS settings"
        log_info "  - Verify proxy settings if in corporate environment"
        log_info "  - Test with: export HTTP_PROXY=http://proxy:port"
        return 1
    elif [[ $successful_connections -lt 3 ]]; then
        log_warning "Limited internet connectivity ($successful_connections/${#connectivity_targets[@]} targets reachable)"
        log_info "This may cause issues with package downloads"
    else
        log_success "Internet connectivity confirmed ($successful_connections/${#connectivity_targets[@]} targets reachable)"
    fi
    
    return 0
}
```

## **4. Lack of Recovery Suggestions and User Guidance**

**Issue**: When prerequisite checks fail, the script provides minimal guidance on how to resolve the issues. Users are left to figure out solutions independently, which can lead to frustration and delayed resolution.

**Benefits**: Providing actionable recovery suggestions improves user experience, reduces support burden, enables self-service problem resolution, and accelerates the development environment setup process.

**Recommendation**:
```bash:check-prerequisites.sh
# Recovery suggestions mapping
declare -A RECOVERY_SUGGESTIONS=(
    ["sudo_access"]="Install sudo: apt update && apt install sudo; Add user to sudo group: usermod -aG sudo \$USER"
    ["internet_connectivity"]="Check network: ping 8.8.8.8; Configure proxy: export HTTP_PROXY=http://proxy:port; Check DNS: cat /etc/resolv.conf"
    ["ubuntu_version"]="Upgrade Ubuntu: do-release-upgrade; Check version: lsb_release -a"
    ["disk_space"]="Free space: apt autoremove && apt autoclean; Check usage: df -h; Clean logs: journalctl --vacuum-time=7d"

           [[ "$version_major" -eq "$MIN_UBUNTU_VERSION_MAJOR" && "$version_minor" -lt "$MIN_UBUNTU_VERSION_MINOR" ]]; then
            log_error "Ubuntu $ubuntu_version is not supported (minimum: ${MIN_UBUNTU_VERSION_MAJOR}.${MIN_UBUNTU_VERSION_MINOR})"

            return 0
        fi
    fi
}
```

## **5. Missing Detailed Prerequisite Summary and Selective Check Options**

**Issue**: The script runs all checks sequentially without options for selective execution, and provides limited summary information about what was checked and what the requirements actually are. Users cannot skip non-critical checks or get detailed information about why certain prerequisites are needed.

**Benefits**: Selective check execution improves flexibility for different scenarios, detailed summaries help users understand system requirements, and documentation of prerequisites aids in troubleshooting and planning.

**Recommendation**:
```bash:check-prerequisites.sh
# Command line argument parsing for selective checks
parse_arguments() {
    local skip_checks=()
    local only_checks=()
    local show_requirements=false
    local force_continue=false
    
    while [[ $# -gt 0 ]]; do
        case $1 in
            --skip)
                IFS=',' read -ra skip_checks <<< "$2"
                shift 2
                ;;
            --only)
                IFS=',' read -ra only_checks <<< "$2"
                shift 2
                ;;

                show_requirements=true
                shift
                ;;
