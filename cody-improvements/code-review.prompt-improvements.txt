Based on my analysis of the `.github/prompts/code-review.prompt.md` file, here are 5 key areas for improvement:

## **1. Missing Specific Code Quality Metrics and Thresholds**

**Issue**: The prompt provides qualitative guidance but lacks specific, measurable criteria for code quality assessment.

**Benefits**: Quantifiable metrics would provide consistent, objective code review standards and help reviewers identify specific improvement targets.

**Recommendation**:
```markdown
## Code Quality Metrics

### Complexity Thresholds
- **Function Length**: Functions should not exceed 50 lines (excluding comments)
- **Cyclomatic Complexity**: Maximum of 10 decision points per function
- **Nesting Depth**: Maximum 4 levels of nested control structures
- **Parameter Count**: Functions should have ≤5 parameters

### Shell Script Specific Metrics
- **Line Length**: Maximum 120 characters per line
- **Function Cohesion**: Each function should have single responsibility
- **Error Handling Coverage**: Every external command must have error handling
- **Variable Scope**: Local variables must be declared with `local` keyword

### Performance Benchmarks
- **Startup Time**: Scripts should complete initialization in <2 seconds
- **Memory Usage**: Avoid operations that consume >100MB RAM
- **File I/O**: Batch file operations when processing >10 files
- **Network Timeouts**: All network operations must have explicit timeouts
```

## **2. Incomplete Security Review Framework**

**Issue**: The security section mentions basic patterns but lacks a comprehensive security assessment framework for shell scripts.

**Benefits**: A structured security framework would help identify vulnerabilities systematically and ensure consistent security standards across all scripts.

**Recommendation**:
```markdown
## Security Assessment Framework

### Input Validation Checklist
- [ ] All user inputs are validated before use
- [ ] Path traversal attacks prevented (no `../` in paths)
- [ ] Command injection prevented (proper quoting/escaping)
- [ ] File permissions validated before access
- [ ] Environment variables sanitized

### Privilege and Access Control
- [ ] Principle of least privilege applied
- [ ] Root access requirements justified and documented
- [ ] Temporary files created with restrictive permissions (600/700)
- [ ] Sensitive data not logged or exposed in error messages
- [ ] Credential handling follows secure patterns

### System Interaction Security
```bash
# Security Review Checklist Examples:

# ❌ Vulnerable pattern
user_input="$1"
eval "ls $user_input"  # Command injection risk

# ✅ Secure pattern  
user_input="$1"
if [[ "$user_input" =~ ^[a-zA-Z0-9/_.-]+$ ]]; then
    ls "$user_input"
else
    log_error "Invalid input format"
    exit 1
fi
```

### Audit Trail Requirements
- [ ] All privileged operations logged
- [ ] Error conditions recorded with context
- [ ] Security-relevant events tracked
- [ ] Log rotation and retention configured
```

## **3. Missing Integration with Project-Specific Standards**

**Issue**: The prompt is generic and doesn't reference the specific utility modules, logging conventions, or architectural patterns used in this Ubuntu development environment project.

**Benefits**: Project-specific guidance would ensure code reviews align with established patterns and maintain consistency across the codebase.

**Recommendation**:
```markdown
## Project-Specific Standards

### Utility Module Integration
- [ ] Scripts source appropriate utility modules (`util-log.sh`, `util-env.sh`, etc.)
- [ ] Environment detection uses `detect_environment()` from util-env.sh
- [ ] Logging follows project conventions (`log_info`, `log_error`, `log_success`)
- [ ] Package management uses `util-packages.sh` functions

### Architecture Compliance
```bash
# Required script structure for this project:
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -euo pipefail

# Source utility modules
SCRIPT_DIR="$(cd "$(dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")" && pwd)"
source "$SCRIPT_DIR/util-log.sh"
source "$SCRIPT_DIR/util-env.sh"

# Initialize logging
init_logging
log_info "Script started: $(basename "$0")"

# Environment detection
ENV_TYPE=$(detect_environment)
case "$ENV_TYPE" in
    "$ENV_WSL")
        # WSL-specific logic
        ;;
    "$ENV_DESKTOP")
        # Desktop-specific logic
        ;;
    "$ENV_HEADLESS")
        # Headless-specific logic
        ;;
esac

# Cleanup
finish_logging
```

### Code Review Integration Points
- [ ] VS Code installation logic respects environment type
- [ ] Container tools follow project's containerd/nerdctl standards
- [ ] Package installations use project's preferred sources (NodeSource, deadsnakes PPA)
- [ ] Configuration files follow project templates (.wslconfig, wsl.conf patterns)
```

## **4. Lack of Automated Review Integration Guidance**

**Issue**: The prompt focuses on manual review but doesn't address integration with automated tools, CI/CD pipelines, or pre-commit hooks.

**Benefits**: Automated review integration would catch common issues before human review, making the review process more efficient and consistent.

**Recommendation**:
```markdown
## Automated Review Integration

### Pre-Commit Validation
```yaml
# .pre-commit-config.yaml integration
repos:
  - repo: local
    hooks:
      - id: shellcheck
        name: ShellCheck
        entry: shellcheck
        language: system
        files: \.sh$
        args: [--severity=warning]
      
      - id: bash-syntax
        name: Bash Syntax Check
        entry: bash -n
        language: system
        files: \.sh$
      
      - id: custom-validation
        name: Project Standards Check
        entry: ./validate-script-standards.sh
        language: system
        files: \.sh$
```

### CI/CD Integration Checklist
- [ ] All shell scripts pass ShellCheck with no warnings
- [ ] Scripts follow project naming conventions
- [ ] Required utility module dependencies verified
- [ ] Environment compatibility tested (WSL2, Desktop, Headless)
- [ ] Installation scripts tested in clean environments

### Review Automation Tools
- **ShellCheck**: Static analysis for shell scripts
- **bashate**: Style checker for bash scripts  
- **Custom Linters**: Project-specific validation scripts
- **Security Scanners**: Check for common security patterns

### Integration with GitHub Actions
```yaml
name: Shell Script Review
on: [pull_request]
jobs:
  shell-review:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Run ShellCheck
        uses: ludeeus/action-shellcheck@master
      - name: Validate Project Standards
        run: ./scripts/validate-all-scripts.sh
```
```

## **5. Missing Review Outcome Documentation and Follow-up Process**

**Issue**: The prompt doesn't specify how review findings should be documented, prioritized, or tracked through resolution.

**Benefits**: Structured documentation and follow-up processes ensure review findings are addressed systematically and knowledge is preserved for future reviews.

**Recommendation**:
```markdown
## Review Documentation and Follow-up

### Review Findings Classification
```markdown
## Code Review Summary
